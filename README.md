# harmonica-notes-converter
A simple program to convert sa re ga ma notes to harmonica(mouth organ) notes
Usually in case of hindi and nepali songs there are notes in sa re ga ma ...... etc and tutorials for instruments are in notes like C, C# , B, F etc . 
I made this program to directly give sa re ga ma notes to hole number with blow and draw where number mean blow and (number) mean draw.

additionally can be converted to C, C# , B, F  from sa re ga ma or vice versa for who understands.

will try to add text files and detect notes in future .
